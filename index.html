    <p id = 'main'> Hello! I'm Anh Nguyen, a third-year Data Science and Biochemistry major at Northeastern. 
        I'm also an international student coming from Saigon, Vietnam. I first started college as a Biochemistry
        major but after taking a foundational Data Science course, I have discovered my interest for Data Science
        and decided to pursue a combined major! I'm currently a TA for the class DS2500, and I really enjoy supporting
        students with programming and data cleaning, analysis, visualization skills. This summer, I had completed my first 
        co-op in the Informatics team at ReNAgade Therapeutics, where I was able to develop computational and visualization tools 
        to facilitate research on RNA medicines and delivery platforms. Besides biochemistry and data science, I'm also passionate
        about music and art. My music taste is quite all over the place but I love to go to concerts and discover new
        artists across all genres! I used to play the piano and the guitar, but I wasn't able to bring my instruments
        with me when studying abroad here in the U.S. so I'm taking a break from practicing these instruments. As for art, 
        I'm interested in graphic design and I had worked on a few design side projects in high school. Some of the tools
        I was able to self-learned in graphic design are Canva, as well as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. These
        experiences have also led me to develop an interest for data visualization through programming and using different
        libraries! Thank you for visiting my website :)
