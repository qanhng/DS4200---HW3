        <p>Currently, whilst shopping for clothing or accessories, people run into the issue of too many choices, many of which are not 
        personalized to their preferences. Our product, Tailored, minimizes this indecisiveness when shopping. Acting as a blend of 
        Google and Pinterest, Tailored will allow users to bring their fashion vision board to reality. The app will take in input 
        information relating to their stylistic choices and demographics such as age, gender, preferred color palettes, textures, 
        purpose of purchase, price range, gender, and urgency. From this user information, the app will select from multiple databases, 
        the appropriate clothing options for the user, and display outfits with links to the specific pieces. This personalized method 
        of shopping allows users to streamline their decisions.</p>

        <li><a href="https://github.com/qanhng/DS2500-Final-Project">The relationship between ambient ozone concentration and heart disease mortality rate - Correlation and Prediction</a></li>
        <p>This project aimed to train a k-nearest neighbor model on ozone concentrations across different states in the U.S. between 2015
        and 2020, as well as heart disease mortality rate, so that it has the ability to predict mortality rate due to heart diseases
        in the future based on ambient ozone concentration. It also visualizes the heart disease mortality risk of each state and the
        levels of ozone concentration on the U.S. map to demonstrate the relationship between these variables. Finally, the project 
        utilized linear regression to investigate the correlation between ozone concentration and heart disease.</p>

        <li>NGS Visualizer</li>
        <p>This web application was built with Streamlit with the goal of helping scientists visualize their next generation sequencing plates
        by simply inputting the plate's barcode. It retrieves data using Benchling API and returns plate contents as a formatted and
        color coded table.</p>
